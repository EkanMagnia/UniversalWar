				<h3>Universal War</h3>
				Are you a person who fancies science fiction? Have you ever dreamed to become a great commander of a planet, in the large Universe?<br /><br />

				Now you have a chance: Universal War. It is a science fiction, web based game, set in space. You are the leader of a planet and you need to construct your buildings, develop your technologies, build your mighty fleets and attack your rivals for Universal Supremacy. You need to make pacts with other commanders, to be part of a great system and of a powerful alliance in your way to success. Those enraged, and those with the skills of a true armchair strategist grow. But only those who can seam these two to a fine perfection will triumph.<br /><br />
				
				In Universal War every player controls his own planet, which he needs to defend by military means in order to survive trespassers. To grow and develop your planet, you will need a good defensive sistem and fleets able to wreak havok among the others. But in order to acomplish this you need resources, obtained through the scanning for probes or by stealing them, so that you'll have acces to more and more of them. Every planet belongs to a system, which contains nine other planets. The planet commanders of the system need to co-operate and help each other in need, so that they become a winning team.<br /><br />
				
				Universal War is a tick based game. In the beta stage the ticks will be 1 minute and 1 round will last for 1-2 week.
